## 💡 Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  
`arr[] = [2, 6, 1, 9, 4, 5, 3]`  
**Output:**  
`6`  
**Explanation:**  
The longest consecutive subsequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

### Example 2
**Input:**  
`arr[] = [1, 9, 3, 10, 4, 20, 2]`  
**Output:**  
`4`  
**Explanation:**  
The longest consecutive subsequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

---

### Example 3
**Input:**  
`arr[] = [15, 13, 12, 14, 11, 10, 9]`  
**Output:**  
`7`  
**Explanation:**  
The longest consecutive subsequence is `[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]`.

# ðŸ§® Union of Arrays with Duplicates

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

You are given two arrays `a[]` and `b[]`, and your task is to **return the Union** of both arrays in any order.

> ðŸ”¹ The Union of two arrays is a collection of all **distinct elements** present in either of the arrays.  
> ðŸ”¹ If an element appears more than once in one or both arrays, it should still appear **only once** in the result.  
> ðŸ”¹ Elements in arrays `a[]` and `b[]` **may not be distinct**.  
> ðŸ”¹ You can return the union in any order, but the driver code will print the result in **sorted order**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Examples

### Example 1
```text
Input: a[] = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], b[] = [3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2]
Output: [1, 2, 3]
Explanation: Union set of both arrays is {1, 2, 3}

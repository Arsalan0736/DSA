## 📜 Problem Statement
Given an array `arr[]` containing only **non-negative integers**, your task is to find a **continuous subarray** (contiguous sequence of elements) whose sum equals a specified value `target`.

You must return the **1-based indices** of the leftmost and rightmost elements of this subarray.  
If there is **no such subarray**, return `[-1]`.

You need to find **the first subarray** whose sum is equal to the target.

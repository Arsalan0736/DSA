# Longest Substring with Distinct Characters

## Problem Description
You are given a string `s`. You have to find the length of the longest substring with all distinct characters.

## Examples

### Example 1
Input:  
`s = "geeksforgeeks"`  
Output:  
`7`  
Explanation: `"eksforg"` is the longest substring with all distinct characters.

### Example 2
Input:  
`s = "aaa"`  
Output:  
`1`  
Explanation: `"a"` is the longest substring with all distinct characters.

### Example 3
Input:  
`s = "abcdefabcbb"`  
Output:  
`6`  
Explanation: The longest substring with all distinct characters is `"abcdef"`, which has a length of 6.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 3 × 10⁴  
- All the characters are in lowercase.

## Expected Complexities
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
- **Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

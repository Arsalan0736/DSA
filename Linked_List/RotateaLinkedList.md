# ðŸš€ Rotate a Linked List (Left Rotation)

### ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Given the head of a singly linked list, your task is to **rotate the linked list to the left by `k` positions**.  

Rotation means shifting nodes to the left and appending the removed nodes at the end.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Example 
**Input:**
head = 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40 -> 50
k = 4

**Rotations:**
Rotate 1: 20 -> 30 -> 40 -> 50 -> 10
Rotate 2: 30 -> 40 -> 50 -> 10 -> 20
Rotate 3: 40 -> 50 -> 10 -> 20 -> 30
Rotate 4: 50 -> 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40

**Output:**
50 -> 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40
